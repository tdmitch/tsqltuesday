[Invitation](http://jasonbrimhall.info/2016/07/27/t-sql-tuesday-081-sharpen-something/) and [roundup ](http://jasonbrimhall.info/2016/08/18/t-sql-tuesday-081-recap/)from [Jason Brimhall](http://jasonbrimhall.info/).

It has now been 30 months since the last time I hosted a TSQL Tuesday, that was TSQL Tuesday 51. I [recapped that event here](http://bit.ly/1oQkFTz) with the [original invite here](http://bit.ly/1ikg6fJ). I can’t believe it has been that long since I last hosted. It only seems like yesterday.

Coming into the present day, we are now at TSQL Tuesday 81. For this month, I would like to try and up the ante a bit. Usually we only get about a weeks notice prior to the event to think about the article to write for the event.

This time, I want to invite everybody just a little bit sooner and will follow-up with a reminder seven days prior to the event. The reason I want to do this is because I think this may be a touch more difficult this time.

This month I am asking you to not only write a post but to do a little homework – *first*. In other words, plan to do something, carry out that plan, and then write about the experience. There is a lot going into that last sentence. Because of that, let me try to explain through a few examples of what I might like to see. Hopefully these examples will help you understand the intent and how this month the topic relates to “**Sharpening Something**“.

## EXAMPLES

1. You have learned about a really cool feature called [Azure DevTest Lab](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devtest-lab/). Having heard about it, you wish to implement this feature to solve some need in your personal development or corporate environment. Develop a plan to implement the feature and tell us the problem it solves and about your experiences in getting it to work from start to end. *An example of how I might try to use this might involve the creation of a disposable and easy setup environment for Precons, Workshops, and various other types of training.*
2. There is a really awesome book about SQL Server you heard about and you decided to buy it. Plan to sit down and read the book. Take a nugget or two from the book and tell us how you can use that nugget of information within your personal or professional environment.
3. You know you are extremely deficient at a certain SQL Skill. Tell me what that skill is and develop a plan to get better at that skill. Report on the implementation of this skill and how you are doing at improving. Maybe that skill is about Extended Events, PoSH or availability groups.
4. Similar to the skill deficiency, you know you do not understand a certain concept within SQL Server as well as you feel you should. Maybe that concept is indexing or statistics (for example). Create a two week plan to become more proficient at that concept. Follow that plan and report on your progress.

In recap, this is an invite to make a short term goal covering the next two weeks. Tell everybody what that goal is (in your tsql tuesday post of course) and how you went about creating a plan for that goal and how you have progressed during the two week interval.

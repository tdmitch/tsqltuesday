Invitation from David Howard. (site gone, but invitation here).

Every new year brings with it a fresh start, a second chance to do things differently. In the spirit of second chances, for this month’s T-SQL Tuesday, please pick any one of the previous 25 T-SQL Tuesday topics and write about it. You can choose one of the topics you participated in before, or you can choose one you missed for some reason. ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20120114071825im_/http://davidbrycehoward.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tsqltuesday.gif)

Maybe you were just too busy when Michael Swart invited everyone to write about [indexes](https://web.archive.org/web/20120114071825/http://michaeljswart.com/2010/09/invitation-to-participate-in-t-sql-tuesday-10-indexes/). Or maybe you weren’t quite happy with the CTE post you came up with when Bob Pusateri [hosted](https://web.archive.org/web/20120114071825/http://www.bobpusateri.com/archive/2011/04/invitation-to-t-sql-tuesday-18-ctes/). Or maybe you have a ton to say about IO, but like me, you didn’t know anything about T-SQL Tuesday until long after Mike Walsh’s [month](https://web.archive.org/web/20120114071825/http://www.straightpathsql.com/archives/2010/03/invitation-for-t-sql-tuesday-004-io/).

Well now is your chance to set things straight! In fact, if you like, you can even throw down a few resolutions for the new year (see Jen McCown’s [#14](https://web.archive.org/web/20120114071825/http://www.midnightdba.com/Jen/2011/01/t-sql-tuesday-resolutions/)). And if this is your first T-SQL Tuesday, just pick a topic and jump in.

## Wrap Up

Thank you everyone who participated in T-SQL Tuesday #026! I really enjoyed hosting and reading all of the contributions. Thanks also to Adam Machanic ([blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://sqlblog.com/blogs/adam_machanic/) / [@AdamMachanic](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://twitter.com/adammachanic)) for starting this monthly event and for allowing me to run this show this time around.

We had 14 posts, covering about 10 different topics depending on how you count. Here’s a brief summary of them all, in the order received.

1. The first post was from Rob Farley ([blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/default.aspx) / [@rob\_farley](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://twitter.com/rob_farley)), a T-SQL Tuesday regular and one of my favorite SQL bloggers.![](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502im_/http://davidbrycehoward.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tsqltuesday.gif) He writes about a limitation of using [APPLY](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2012/01/10/apply-not-exactly-set-based.aspx) when dealing with working calculations which he had written about in an [earlier post](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/archive/2011/12/13/a-t-sql-tip-working-calculations.aspx).

He also let us in on his 2012 resolutions, which match up with mine in a lot of ways (except for that one with the “O” word ![:)](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502im_/http://davidbrycehoward.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) )

4. After a brief intro in French and some cool New Year’s Eve images, Jason Brimhall ([blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://jasonbrimhall.info/) / [@sqlrnnr](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://twitter.com/sqlrnnr)) covers several type of ways to [perform JOINs](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://jasonbrimhall.info/2012/01/10/tsql-tuesday-26-or-23-identity-crisis/) on tables where a bitmask is applied to an id field.

5. I enjoyed reading Jason Grobe’s ([blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://jgrobe.wordpress.com/) / [@sqlmental](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://twitter.com/sqlmental)) [resolutions](https://web.archive.org/web/20120331050502/http://jgrobe.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/t-sql-tuesday-026-its-2012-already/), which cover both personal, professional and community oriented goals. More power to you Jason!

Very cool.

I really like her idea of breaking them down into monthly chunks so they don’t seem so daunting.
